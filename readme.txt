Checklist for WordPress core, plugin updates and themes updates. What should your developer always check.

== Description ==
WordPress update seems to be basic stuff. You just click Update now and thatâ€™s all. Unfortunately we have seen countless WordPress errors after various updates or rutine changes.

These are usually caused by using some deprecated codes or not compatible plugins. Sometimes there may be some issue with a server memory, PHP or database. We have recently started to use the checklist for WordPress core, plugins or themes update.
